# astro-business-starter

Static business-site starter: Astro 5 + Tailwind CSS v4, token-driven theming, an accessible
header, and full SEO output. Builds to plain HTML for cPanel/Apache hosting.

Three pages ship (`/`, `/404`, `/thank-you/`). Everything else — about, services, contact, legal,
a blog — is added per project from the block library. There is no CMS and no content collection
until a project needs one.

## Theming

`tokens/*.json` is the only committed source of design values. `src/styles/theme.css` is
**generated** from it on every `dev`, `build`, and `verify`, and is gitignored — never edit it.

Tokens map straight onto Tailwind v4 namespaces, so `color.brand.500` becomes `--color-brand-500`
and yields `bg-brand-500`. Semantic aliases (`surface`, `ink`, `line`) point at the raw scales, so
a rebrand usually means editing the brand ramp alone.

There is **no override stylesheet**. If one place needs a different value, that is a component-level
decision — a prop or a local class — not a global escape hatch.

Tokens can come from a Figma library via Tokens Studio, from another tool's export, or from editing
the JSON by hand. The pipeline cannot tell the difference.

## Layout model

Every block is `Section > Container > content`:

- **`Section`** — full viewport width. Owns background, vertical rhythm, semantic tag.
- **`Container`** — `max-w-page` (1350px), centred, with gutters. Owns content arrangement.

Adjacent `Section`s sharing a background collapse the seam automatically (see `global.css`), so
stacked bands read as one flow while a colour change keeps its full padding.

Responsive is **desktop-first** using Tailwind `max-*` variants. See `docs/RESPONSIVE-RULES.md`.

## Deploying

Static output in `dist/` uploads as-is. `public/.htaccess` handles HTTPS, non-www, trailing
slashes, compression, cache headers, and the 404. `trailingSlash: 'always'` + `build.format:
'directory'` are pinned together — changing one without the other breaks URLs on Apache.
